# BMI Calculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to determine if your weight is within a healthy range. 

To calculate your BMI, you need to enter your weight in kilograms and your height in centimeters. The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

## BMI Categories:

- **Underweight**: A BMI less than 18.5  
- **Normal weight**: A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9  
- **Overweight**: A BMI between 25 and 29.9  
- **Obesity**: A BMI of 30 or greater
